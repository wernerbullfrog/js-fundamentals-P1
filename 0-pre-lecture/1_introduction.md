# Introduction

## Programming

Programming is the act of constructing a program --a set of precise instructions that tell a computer what to do.

- It allows you to do things in seconds that would take forever by hand.
- It provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.

It's hard. It can be really hard, but there is a relatively small set of fundamental principles. It's a steep learning curve with a low-barrier of entry and lots of small plateaus that allow you to feel good about your progress. _We are definitely going to leverage that in the bootcamp._

It will be terribly frustrating at times. Enjoy it. :)

> The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which [s]he alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs. (Joseph Weizenbaum, "Computer Power and Human Reason")

## JavaScript

JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator.🤯 _Yeah, that doesn't exist anymore._ JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java. "Java" was added to the name to capitalize on the popularity of Java, the language. It was a marketing decision.

JavaScript was stable for a long time, from 2009 to 2015. In that time, the language changed very little. That version is known as ES5. **In 2015, ES6 was released and included TONS of new functionality.** Along the way, it was also renamed ES2015. There have since been yearly releases that have brought improvements to the language. The JavaScript community is vast and active.

### What does "ES" stands for?

ES stands for ECMAScript. ECMAScript is a standard for creating a scripting language. It was introduced by [ECMA International](https://www.ecma-international.org/) and is adopted by JavaScript.

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language. It compbines tools for [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

As we start learning JS, we'll focus on a mix of all three. We'll take a more [procedural approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming).
