## What is programming?

---

Programming is the act of constructing a _program_ --a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

- It allows you to do things in seconds that would take forever by hand.
- It provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.
- It's hard...
  - but there is a relatively small set of fundamental principles.
- It's fun...
  - but also _terribly_ frustrating at times.

## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator. 🤯
- JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java.
- JavaScript was stable for a long time at version 5 (ES5) from 2009 to 2015.
- In 2015, ES2015 was released and included TONS of new functionality.
- There have been yearly releases since then, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019...

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, combining tools for

- [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)
- [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
- [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) programming.

_The style of programming we'll learn to use during our course is best described as [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)._
