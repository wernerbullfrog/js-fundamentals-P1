// Q6
// Take the code you wrote in Q5 and now let's create a
// reusable function that takes two arguments,
// numbers that dictate the range within which to look for 
// Armstrong numbers.

// This means that our code from the previous question will need to be tweaked a little
// to determine Armstrong numbers of different lengths.
// e.g.
// a number of 1 digit; each digit is to the power of 1
// a number of 2 digit; each digit is to the power of 2
// a number of 3 digit; each digit is to the power of 3
// a number of 4 digit; each digit is to the power of 4
// a number of 5 digit; each digit is to the power of 5

// See this site for a list of "narcissistic" numbers
