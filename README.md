# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

Today we will be learning the fundamentals of JavaScript!

## Setup

In order to easily evaluate your answers, you will need a `node` environment. We could use the browser, as I did during the lecture, but it would be easier to manage if there was a way to do this in VS Code. There is! 🤯

You can toggle the terminal window in VS Code with the following keyboard shortcut:

- `[ctrl + j]` on Windows
- `[cmd + j]` on Mac

This will open an instance of the terminal (Mac) or the PowerShell (Win). 

There are 2 ways to evaluate your JS using Node:

### Type JS directly into the Node Env.

- Type `node` in the terminal, and hit `enter`.

This will turn that terminal into a Node environment for you to play with.

You can type JavaScript in the same way I did while using the Browser console.

#### Exit the Node Environment

To exit/quit Node and get back to the terminal, do `[ctrl + c]` twice.

### Use Node to execute files

To run your exercise files, you will need to type the following command at the terminal/PowerShell prompt:

```js
node <PATH TO FILE>
```

The _easiest_ way to do this is to type `node`, hit [space] and then drag the file you want to evaluate into the terminal. This will place the path into the command line.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the right folder using `cd` and then you could type `node <FILE_NAME>`.
