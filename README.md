# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

Today we will be learning the fundamentals of JavaScript!

---

## 🦊 Pre-lecture

⏲️ _Estimated time required: 30 minutes to 1 hour._

1. Read all of the `.md` files in `0-pre-lecture`. It covers the initial fundamental concepts that we will be starting with during the lecture.
2. There are also some exercises that you should complete.

> 💡 If you are in VS Code, you can right-click on any markdown file and select "Open Preview" to view a more "readable" version of it.

## Workshop Setup

Before starting the workshop, please run the following in the terminal. It will install all of the required dependencies. (More on that later.)

Type `ctrl`+ `j` to open the terminal inside of VS Code.

```bash
yarn install
```

In order to more easily evaluate your answers, you will need a `node` environment. VS Code provides us with a terminal, and in the terminal we can evaluate js files with Node.

It really **NOT** recommended that you use the browser console.

> 💡 You can toggle the terminal window in VS Code with the following keyboard shortcut:
>
> - `[ctrl + j]` on Windows
> - `[cmd + j]` on Mac

This will open an instance of the terminal (Mac) or the PowerShell (Win).

## Type JS directly into the Node Env.

- Type the following in the terminal, and hit `enter`.

```bash
node 2-workshop/exercise-3.js
```

This will execute all of the code in the `exercise-3.js` file.

---

## Testing

This workshop can "test" your code and validate your answers. (We will talk more about this later.)

If you want to test your code/validate your answer, you can type `yarn test <FILE_NAME>` in the terminal (without the `.js`).

In this workshop, there will be a reminder to do this at the end of every exercise file.
